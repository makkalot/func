This is just an attempt to note what a release needs, mainly
so I don't forget.


- tag the git tree for the release
	git tag -a release_name
	
	release name is of the form v0.25

	see "git tag -l" for examples of existing tags

	probably want to wait until you know the latter steps
	work correctly before tagging.

- rev the version (version is set in setup.py, funcs.spec, and the
Makefile. I really hate having this in three places but my previous
approach ('version' file) was frowned upon by fedora build system

- build a tarball (I currently just use "make" or "make rpms"
and use the tarball from rpm-build/)

- write up the release notes
	More is better. See "git log" and func trace timeline for
	a start.

- push the tarball to it's upstream home. Currently it's at
	http://people.fedoraproject.org/~alikins/files/func/
	
  But it can move if need be. Just update the trac wiki Releases page.

- build the rpms for fedora/epel

	I mostly use the "pusher.py" script for this, as it automates
	most of this somewhat tedious process. 

	There is a lot of setup needed before it will run correctly
	however. You need to get a fedora package maintainer setup
	up and running. The fedora devel docs go into more detail
	about this.

	Check the PROCESS_RELEASES variable in pusher.py. This defines
	what releases to build packages for. You may need to update
	this if new releases are available as targets since the last
	time it was built.

	Run it like:

		./pusher.py --cvs ~/cvs/func --prof ~/src/func

	--cvs points to your checkout of the fedora "dist-cvs" tree
	for func
	
	Currently that is cvsroot :ext:USERNAME@cvs.fedoraproject.org:/cvs/pkgs

	See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Using_Fedora_CVS

	--proj just points to a git checkout of the project that you
	have built the rpms for (pusher.py assume PROJECT/rpm-build exists
	and has been populated)

- once the packages have been built, they need to be pushed into the
fedora update system

- EPEL packages are mostly pulled automatically if they have been built for
EPEL with "plague" (pusher.py builds for this automatically if a rhel target has been put into "PROCESS_RELEASES" in pusher.py
